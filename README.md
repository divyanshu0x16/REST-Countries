## Overview

  

### The challenge

  

Users should be able to:

  

- See all countries from the API on the homepage

- Search for a country using an `input` field

- Filter countries by region

- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page

- Click through to the border countries on the detail page

- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

  

### Screenshot

  

![](./screenshot.jpg)

  

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

  

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

  

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

  

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
